To use our docker image, we have provided a handy docker-compose file.

You will need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

Simply download the [compose file](docker-compose.yml), and run:
```
$ docker-compose up
```

There are a number of environment variables that are commented out.
The usage for those are explained in the compose file.
